		<h1><b>Terms</b> of Use</h1>
		<h2>(Last updated: October 21, 2014)</h2>
		<div class="legal-block">
			<p>Welcome to Swarm. By using this website (the “Site”) and services (together with the Site, the “Services”) offered by EVRGR Corporation, (“Swarm”), you agree to comply with and be legally bound by these terms (the “Terms”). If you do not agree to any of the terms set forth herein, you may not access or use any of the Services.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="legal-block">
			<h3>1. Definitions.</h3>
			<p>In these Terms, we refer to those raising funds as “Project Creators” and to their fundraising campaigns and the subsequent development of their products or services as “Projects”. We refer to those contributing funds as “Backers” and to the funds they contribute as “Pledges”. Project Creators, Backers and other visitors to the Services are referred to collectively as “Users”.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="legal-block">
			<h3>2. The swarm platform.</h3>
			<p>Swarm provides a funding platform for creative projects. When a Project is approved and posted on the platform, the Project Creator is inviting other people to form a contract with them. By making a Pledge, Backers are accepting the Project Creator’s offer and forming a contract with them. Project Creator’s can offer gifts or rewards to Backer’s in the form of cryptographic tokens, redeemable with the Project Creator at some point in the future for tangible products or intangible services (“Rewards”).</p>
		</div>

		<div class="legal-block">
			<h3>3. Obligations.</h3>
			<p>When a Project receives a Pledge from a Backer, the Project Creator becomes legally obligated to complete the Project and provide each Backer with their Reward. If a Project Creator is unable fulfill any of these obligations, the Project Creator agrees to use every reasonable effort to pursue a compromise with the Backers of the Project. Project Creators are solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their Project. If they’re unable to satisfy these Terms, they may be subject to legal action by Backers.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="legal-block">
			<h3>4. Rewards.</h3>
			<p>In consideration for funding a Project, a Project Creator may offer a Reward to a Backer. Rewards will initially come in the form of cryptographic tokens and will be distributed to a Backer shortly after receiving the Pledge, in an amount proportional to the Pledge amount. At some point in the future (e.g. when the Project is completed) the tokens will be redeemable for tangible products or intangible services as specified by the Project Creator. A token may also have additional rights associate with it, such as the right to vote on aspects or the direction of the product or service. Project Creators are not permitted to provide any of the following as a Reward:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>a security (as such term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933)</p></li>
				<li><p>any form of financial incentive or profit sharing instrument</p></li>
				<li><p>illegal goods</p></li>
				<li><p>drug or alcohol related paraphernalia</p></li>
				<li><p>illicit or offensive material</p></li>
				<li><p>weapons or related accessories</p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="legal-block">
			<h3>5. Pledges.</h3>
			<p><b>5.1 Bitcoin.</b> Pledges can be made in either US Dollars or bitcoin. Because bitcoin transactions are irreversible, make sure you are using the correct wallet address before you fund a Project. Project Creators will receive all Pledges, minus any fees received Swarm, at the conclusion of the fundraising campaign. Receipt of Pledges is not conditional upon a Project meeting its funding goal. Project Creators are encouraged to store bitcoin in a secure location (e.g. BitGo Enterprise Multi-Signature Wallet). Swarm is not responsible for lost or stolen bitcoin.</p>
			<p><b>5.2 Project Creators.</b> Responsibility for completing a project lies entirely with the Project Creator. Swarm does not hold funds on a Project Creator’s behalf, cannot guarantee Project Creator’s work, and will not offer refunds. Project Creators may, solely at their own discretion, make individual refunds to Backers. If you return a Pledge to the Backer, you have no further obligation to that Backer, and no agreement exists between you.</p>
			<p><b>5.3 Backers.</b> As a Backer, you are solely responsible for doing your research before funding a Project. All Pledges are made voluntarily and at your sole discretion and risk. Swarm does not guarantee that Pledges will be used as promised, that Project Creators will deliver the Rewards, or that the Project will achieve its goals. Swarm does not endorse, guarantee, make representations, or provide warranties for or about the quality, safety, morality or legality of any Project, Reward, Pledge, or the truth or accuracy of the Project Content.</p>
			<p><b>5.4 Taxes.</b> Project Creators shall be responsible for all tax obligations associated with Pledges and Rewards. Because Pledges may be made in bitcoin, we encourage all Project Creators to consult with a licensed tax advisor from their local jurisdiction when planning their Project to understand and prepare for the tax obligations associated raising funds in digital currency.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="legal-block">
			<h3>6. Fees.</h3>
			<p>Swarm shall receive the fees set forth in the Fee Schedule, in addition to any fees from its payments partners. Fees are collected on all Projects, regardless of whether or not the Project meets its funding goal. Pledges made in fiat currency may be collected and processed by payment providers. Swarm is not responsible for the performance of its payment providers. Users are responsible for paying all taxes associated with the use of the Services.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="legal-block">
